## Usage

(1) Get Data

* Download dataset and check for library dependencies
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/nitishsrivastava/deepnet.git
$ python startup.py
```

This should download all libraries needed. From there, follow instructions on
how to run the deepnet library in the deepnet/ folder.

(2) Train and test Multimodal DBM

* Edit paths in runall_dbm.sh
* Train DBM
```bash
$ cd multimodal_dbm
$ ./runall_dbm.sh
```

Code has been test on Ubuntu 15.04
